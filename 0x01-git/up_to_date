Most of the git commands i used were:
->git add
->git commit
->git clone
->git branch
->git checkout
->git status
->git pull
->git push

Also since i'm writing the what i used how about also including some of the command lines i used:
->ls
->mkdir
->cd
->pwd
->rm
->vim
->cat
->touch


THANK YOU !!!!
